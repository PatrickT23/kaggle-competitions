# kaggle-competitions
This repository is where I will upload Kaggle submissions to their challenges. This is a way of sharing my attempts and I will endeavour to update this as regularly as possible. Below are a list of all the competitions attempted so far in this respository.

## Digit Recogniser
The link to the Kaggle competition is here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/overview

The aim of this competition is to use image recognition techniques (in this case I used CNN) to determine the numbers hand written in 28000 images. Using only 2 epochs and running it locally I produced an accuracy of 96%. Had better computing power been used and more epochs run this could have been increased. Check out the code!
